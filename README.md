>Has your password been compromised?

>Has it ended up in dictionary lists (eg: RockYou.txt) 

>Are you afraid of being susceptible to dictionary attacks?

Ravsawsi is a simple tool for people whose password has been pwned but are too fond of the password to change it or too lazy to switch to another one (like me).

>How can I check if my password has been pwned?

You can go to [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and check if your password has been pwned.
